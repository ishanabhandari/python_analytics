# python_analytics
Welcome to my Python Analytics projects page.

I am a high school senior. You will find my personal learning projects here. 

I am using simple projects to learn the Python programming language and the Python data analytics tools.

Currently, there are 2 projects -

1. The **beneficial effects of hand-washing** in a clinical setting.
2. An **analysis of Uber trips** in New York City and New Jersey.

Each project has its own *readme.md* file. Please refer to those for details.
